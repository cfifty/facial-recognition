#Cornell CS4780 SP 2018 Final Project
Welcome to the CS4780 final project! Unlike the other projects you have completed this semester, you will be given free reign to approach this problem however you like. You are free to use anything you learned in this class as well as anything outside of the scope of the course.

##Dataset
The dataset you are working with is comprised of images of 98 different celebrities. You are tasked with making a model that can properly classify the celebrity that is in the image. The data are given as a zipped file of jpeg images and a JSON that maps the image's filename to its label. We have also provided a 2048 dimensional feature vector for each image in the form of a JSON with its respective label, this feature vector is generated from the convolutional layers of a pre-trained residual neural network. These features are purely optional to use but may be helpful in your implementation. We have provided resources about convolutional layers and residual network architectures under the Resources section if you want to learn more about them.

##Submission
Team: You could work on a team with size up to 5 students.

Submissions: To get full credits on the competition, you are required to submit all of the following on cms:

A prediction for both the validation set and the testing set (submit through Kaggle)
A one-page short report describing your approach
A zip file containing your codes and a README with instructions to reproduce your competition results.

##Academic Dishonesty
We will be checking your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy. If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't try! If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.

*IMPORTANT:* Given the small size of the testing dataset, trying to hand-label the test dataset and claim credits for such hand-labeled results is NOT ALLOWED. Almost everyone could be a good annotator for this task, and we are not testing your ability to recognize faces here. Your submission has to be outputs of your algorithm.

##Getting Help
You are not alone! If you find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help. Office hours, section, and the Piazza are there for your support; please use them. If you can't make our office hours, let us know and we will schedule more. We want these projects to be rewarding and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help unless you ask.
